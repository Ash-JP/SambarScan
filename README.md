# [Broth Bureau‚Ñ¢ ] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [NULL&VOID]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [ AASHRAY_J_PRAMOD ] - [ College_Of_Enginnering_Attingal ]
- Member 2: [ Fathima_Zahara ] - [ College_Of_Enginnering_Attingal ]


### Project Description
[Broth Bureau‚Ñ¢ uses artificial intelligence to determine the consistency of your sambar ‚Äî whether it's gloriously thick or depressingly watery.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People everywhere suffer from poorly made sambar, yet no one has dared to measure its consistency... until now. This is the culinary crisis we‚Äôve chosen to tackle.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We trained a machine learning model to visually inspect sambar and classify it as either:
ü´ó Watery (aka flavoured tears)
üçõ Good Sambar (blessed by Amma herself)
Complete with sarcasm, meme jokes, and fake confidence bars.]
